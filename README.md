Python Projects 

These Projects in Python cover two different skills:

The first "Python Project #33" demonstrates competency in for loops, and nested if/elif statements via an Automatic File Sorter.

On the other hand ...... was a fair bit more complicated, instead of working with a preconstructed dataset via files on my computer, I had to individually scavenge for one with a link via
the BeautifulSoup library.
