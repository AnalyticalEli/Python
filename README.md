Python Projects 

These Projects in Python cover two different skills:

The first "Automatic File Sorter #33" demonstrates competency in for loops, and nested if/elif statements via an Automatic File Sorter.

On the other hand "Webscraper Project #19" was a fair bit more complicated, instead of working with a preconstructed dataset via files on my computer, I had to individually scavenge for one with a link via
the BeautifulSoup library. The purpose was simple, to beautify data through tags (only keeping those that were necessary), create a data frame with the tags, and export it into a CSV file which you can view in the Python folder.
